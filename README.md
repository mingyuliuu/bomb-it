# bomb-it
A simple two-player Bomberman game. ICS3U final project. Coded in Java.

**How to play:**  
Place bombs to destroy the walls. Be the first to collect 6 stars or kill the other player to win the game.  
*Player 1:* Patrick Star; Use W S A D to move, V to palce the bomb.  
*Player 2:* Sponge Bob; Use four direction keys to move, ENTER to place the bomb.

All the images and animations used in the project have been uploaded in the repo.  
Change the path of the images in FinalPR.java from line 75 to line 83. 

Three colors of lollipops (as walls) were used to create a "blinking" effect. If it makes  
you uncomfortable, set variables pic2a, pic2b and pic2c all to one path: lollipop1 OR 2 OR 3.
